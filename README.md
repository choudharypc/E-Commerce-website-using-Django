# E-Commerce-website-using-Django

Introduction:-
E-commerce websites have become essential platforms for buying and selling goods online. This project is inspired by popular platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart but built as a lightweight academic model. The main motivation is to provide users with an easy-to-use system that integrates shopping features with interactive support. The application allows secure user authentication, enabling personalized access to shopping features. Products are displayed with details such as name, price, stock availability, and images. A dynamic shopping cart system allows users to add and remove products seamlessly. The chatbot integration provides a unique feature by responding to user queries directly on the homepage. The project also highlights the practical use of Django for building scalable web applications.

Objectives:-
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a functional e-commerce website using Django. It aims to provide secure user login and registration modules. Another objective is to allow users to browse products with detailed descriptions and images. The system is designed to support adding, updating, and removing items from the cart dynamically. One key objective is to implement a chatbot to enhance customer support. The project also intends to create a responsive interface suitable for multiple devices. It seeks to demonstrate the practical application of the MVC design pattern. An additional goal is to improve user engagement through visually rich product displays. The chatbot is programmed to answer at least five common queries effectively. Finally, the objective is to present a complete, deployable academic project showcasing real-world applications.

Technology Used:-
The project is implemented using Django, a high-level Python web framework. Python is the core programming language for backend development.HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to design and enhance the user interface. Bootstrap is applied to make the design responsive and user-friendly. SQLite/MySQL is used as the database for storing users, products, and cart data. The chatbot functionality is built with JavaScript for front-end interactivity. Django’s template engine is used to dynamically render web pages. The project also makes use of Django’s ORM for secure database operations. Static and media files are handled for displaying product images. Overall, the combination of these technologies ensures a scalable, secure, and efficient system.
